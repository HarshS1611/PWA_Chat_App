# PWA CHAT APP

This is a full stack progressive web app (PWA) chat app that uses react as frontend and firebase for backend and database. This has the authentication for authorized users and can store user chats. The user can chat with text, and also can send images, video, and audio files. Users also have an option to search another user with the username.

## Tech Stack used and approach

- I have used reactjs and scss for building the frontend and styling of the application. 
-  Then I have integrated firebase for authentication using email/password and storing user data such as email, profile picture and user chats.
-  Our users can send and receive multimedia files such as images, audio and video in addition to text messages. For making this application a progressive web app (PWA) I have used workbox library. 
-  Users can also see the recent chats with other users and can search all the users that have created their account in the platform.

## Demo Account for testing -
